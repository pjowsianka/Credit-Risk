# Credit Risk Analysis and Scorecard Development Project

This project focuses on analyzing data for credit risk assessment and developing a scorecard for easier usability. The project follows the following steps:



1. **Data Analysis**: Performing data analysis involved thoroughly examining the dataset to understand its specifics and utilizing visualization techniques to gain insights and detect patterns relevant to credit risk assessment.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: During the data preprocessing phase, dummy variables were created to represent categorical variables in the credit risk modeling project. This approach allowed us to include categorical information in the regression model.

3. **Regression Modeling**: Utilize logistic regression, the most commonly used method in Probability of Default (PD) models, to build a predictive model. Train the model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance on test data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, Gini coefficient, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic. These metrics measure the model's predictive accuracy, discrimination power, and ability to rank borrowers by credit risk.

5. **Scorecard Development**: Transform the regression model into a scorecard, which simplifies the model and enhances its usability. Assign points to different variables based on their coefficients or importance in predicting credit risk. Calibrate the scorecard to ensure meaningful risk assessment.

By following this project's workflow, we aim to analyze credit risk data, develop a predictive model using logistic regression, evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics, and transform it into a user-friendly scorecard. This scorecard will assist in assessing the credit risk of new borrowers and facilitate informed decision-making in credit management.
